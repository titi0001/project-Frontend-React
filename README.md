# Project Solar System
 
  In this project I developed a model of the solar system. By using this application, a user is able to:

  - View all planets of the solar system rendered on the screen;
  - View all cards with information about space missions;
 

## Skills Developed

In this project, I developed the following skills:

  - Use JSX in React
  - Correctly use the render() method to render your components
  - Use import to bring components in different files
  - Create class components in React
  - Create multiple components from an array
  - Make use of props correctly
  - Make use of PropTypes to validate a component's props
